To be able to implement the bubblesort to sort an array of integer in an imperative language( C++ for this lab), 
the user will need :

- assignment of integer
- for loops
- if condition
- boolean assignments
- input and output
- creating and accessing arrays' contains
- calling procedures

the user may also need some procedures ( if he decides to do a procedural abstraction of the code)

- The bubblesort, display and swap procedures (by using pointers "*" and address accessor "&")
