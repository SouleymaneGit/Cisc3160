For this lab I created 3 procedures and the main class;

- the swap procedure takes as parameter two integer(addresses) a and b and exchange there contains by using a temporary variable "temp"
- the display procedure takes as parameter a pointer to an array of integer and an integer which represents the size of the array
   through a for loop the procedure prints the array's elements

- the bubblesort procedure takes as parameter a pointer to an array of integer
  it creates a variable "size" which contains the size of the array
  through two for loops it iterates all the elements of the array by swapping elements if necessary until the array is sort
